I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. Before this, I completed a technical course in Systems Development, where I learned the basics of Java, web development and database management. This background has provided me with a solid foundation to build upon in my current studies. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of software development!
